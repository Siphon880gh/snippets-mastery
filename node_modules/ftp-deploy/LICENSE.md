# The MIT License

Ftp-deploy is derived from (and mostly consists of) the grunt-ftp-deploy plugin written by zonak 
(https://github.com/zonak/grunt-ftp-deploy). Not entirely sure how the MIT is supposed to be followed, but here it is.
ftp-deploy is MIT just as grunt-ftp-deploy is. Below you'll find the license text for both. 
(If anyone knows the proper way of doing this please let me know)
