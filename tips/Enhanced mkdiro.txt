I recommend adding this as an alias `mkdiro` which allows you to create a folder and also cd into it in one command. Conveniently, it is optional to use quotes if the filename has spaces:

function mkdiro () {  concat_args=""${@}""; mkdir "$concat_args"; cd "$concat_args"; };

How to use:
mkdiro +new folder
