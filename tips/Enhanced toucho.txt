I recommend adding this as an alias `toucho` which allows you to create a file and also open it for editing in one command. Conveniently, it is optional to use quotes if the filename has spaces:

function toucho() { concat_args=""${@}""; touch "$concat_args"; open "$concat_args"; };

How to use:
toucho +new file
toucho +meta.json
toucho +meta.txt
