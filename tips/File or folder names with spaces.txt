You can create files or folders at command line. If there are spaces in the name, you would use single quotes. Eg.
mkdir 'new folder'
touch 'new file'

But with the enhanced mkdiro and toucho, you do not need quotes although it's still a valid syntax. In addition, it cd into the new directory or opens the new file so you can immediately continue with further work:

mkdiro new folder
mkdiro 'new folder'
toucho new file
toucho 'new file'

To setup the enhanced commands, refer to mkdiro.txt or toucho.txt
